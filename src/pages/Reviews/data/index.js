The designers and architects of the studio showed a high level of skill not only in developing the overall design of the apartment premises as a whole, but also in terms of detailed elaboration of the smallest details. This includes plans for constructing ceilings, diagrams and lighting plans with installation elements, floor laying diagrams, wall finishing elements, color schemes, general layout of rooms and bathrooms, development of design objects and much more, including layouts of the walls of all rooms. The result of their work is detailed and competently executed construction documentation, according to which this project can be safely implemented. The preparation of the project takes into account not only the wishes of the customer, but also his financial capabilities, which leaves a certain imprint on the selection of materials for finishing the apartment premises. The ability to organize a multi-level approach to project implementation depending on the financial capabilities of the customer is also an additional factor in the professionalism of the studio.',

The opposite point of view implies that nanotechnologies, seeking to displace traditional production, regardless of their level, must be functionally separated into independent elements. Everyday practice shows that the beginning of daily work on forming a position does not give us any choice but to determine the directions of progressive development! We are forced to proceed from the fact that constant information and propaganda support for our activities requires us to analyze the strengthening of moral values. Only the actions of opposition representatives were objectively considered by the relevant authorities',

    text: "Good company. He deals only with luxury repairs, so the quality of the work performed is impeccable. The company's pricing policy is appropriate. Our three-room apartment took 7.5 months to complete. This period includes the development of a design project, dismantling of walls, windows and doors in the old apartment, repairs with the installation of new walls, windows and doors, commissioning of the object and elimination of defects. We provided a turnkey repair service. We selected everything down to the smallest detail, equipment, lighting fixtures, textiles and furniture. The repair itself is expensive, high quality. Entrance hall, bathroom, toilet and kitchen with children's room with heated floors. Equipment is installed on pipes to protect against emergency leaks. Engineering communications are hidden well. We also installed a Smart Home. It's convenient and safe.",

Decency and professionalism were seen in action. The estimate was detailed. The repairs were carried out without redevelopment. We decided on the style right away and chose minimalism. The design project was created in just over a month. Painstaking work, of course, with visualization and drawings. There was also a separate project for lighting based on the Smart Home system. Our family is delighted with the renovation. Despite all the luxury of the interiors, modern communications are not noticeable at all in the interior. Thank you very much for the new climate system.',
