It is necessary to create comfort for guests during feasts and gatherings, to create a good and joyful atmosphere. It is believed that table setting is required only on holidays, but this is a common misconception. You can decorate a meal beautifully and create a small celebration in your family every day.

The color should be chosen to suit the occasion. Place decorations on the table surface so that they are visible to all guests. There is no need to choose too bright products. The container with drinks must be positioned in such a way that everyone has access to them. Set out cutlery and plates in the number of guests planned. It is considered wrong to leave plates for people who never came. Decorate the napkins and place them in the right places. Use bonbonnieres as desired. These are small surprises for guests, such as sweets. Usually they are placed in a small box or bag and placed near the plates. Arrange the glasses.

Whether it will be cozy, strict, cheerful or calm largely depends on the color scheme. To set the right mood in the room and avoid mistakes in combining shades, let's look at the tips. Deciding on the color scheme of a room during renovation is not an easy task. In addition to personal preferences, it is important to consider the rules for combining shades to make the interior comfortable and inviting. To do this, it is worth understanding the basic principles of color. Each color has its own temperature. Red-orange is considered the warmest, and blue-green is considered the coldest. Depending on which shade is closer to which “pole” it is located, it will be warmer or colder. Cool tones - blue, mint, purple, emerald green. An interior built on a combination of cool colors seems light, clean, and fresh. Even the temperature there feels lower. Shades of red, yellow, orange, grassy green, warm and give comfort. In their pure form they carry a lot of energy, and when diluted they soothe and envelop.\",\r\n    text2: 'By the way! Black, white and gray are considered neutral colors and can be easily combined with everything else. The simplest combination is two opposing colors: red and green, yellow and purple, blue and orange. They are also called complementary or contrasting. Pure contrasting colors have great brightness and strong visual impact. To avoid getting tired of the interior, pay attention to their muted shades. For example, instead of bright green, use olive color in the interior. Black often serves as an accent color in living spaces, but gray serves as an excellent neutral base. Colorful spots will be the highlight of the gray monochrome. White walls are the ideal canvas for any design, from classic to high-tech. All combinations of bright and pastel colors play effectively against their background. Not only furniture, but also paintings make the center of the composition. Beige color in the interior is considered by some to be neutral, and it really goes with most colors.

In the kitchen these are areas above the table, cabinets, and sink. Free spaces between windows, niches, and the space above the door are also suitable. Make a composition in advance and try to arrange the elements on the floor. You can place the parts either symmetrically or chaotically.
