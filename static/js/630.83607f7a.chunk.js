At first glance, everything seems very difficult, but after a couple of trainings everything will be easy and quick. It is necessary to create comfort for guests during feasts and gatherings, to create a good and joyful atmosphere. It is believed that table setting is required only on holidays, but this is a common misconception. You can decorate a meal beautifully and create a small celebration in your family every day. To make the table look beautiful, all you need is a clean tablecloth, a few cutlery, and napkins.

It is used to protect the surface of the table and will also muffle sounds. Spread the festive tablecloth directly onto the thick material. When choosing a tablecloth, it is best to consider the effect of shades on people. For example, red increases appetite, blue, on the contrary, dampens it. The color should be chosen to suit the occasion. Place decorations on the table surface so that they are visible to all guests. There is no need to choose too bright products. The container with drinks must be positioned in such a way that everyone has access to them. Set out cutlery and plates in the number of guests planned. It is considered wrong to leave plates for people who never came. Decorate the napkins and place them in the right places. Use bonbonnieres as desired. These are small surprises for guests, such as sweets. Usually they are placed in a small box or bag and placed near the plates. Arrange the glasses. Place chairs opposite each plate so that guests can sit comfortably.

Whether it will be cozy, strict, cheerful or calm largely depends on the color scheme. To set the right mood in the room and avoid mistakes in combining shades, let's look at the tips. Deciding on the color scheme of a room during renovation is not an easy task. In addition to personal preferences, it is important to consider the rules for combining shades to make the interior comfortable and inviting. To do this, it is worth understanding the basic principles of color. Each color has its own temperature. Red-orange is considered the warmest, and blue-green is considered the coldest. Depending on which shade is closer to which \u201cpole\u201d it is located, it will be warmer or colder. Cool tones - blue, mint, purple, emerald green. An interior built on a combination of cool colors seems light, clean, and fresh. Even the temperature there feels lower. Shades of red, yellow, orange, grassy green, warm and give comfort. In their pure form they carry a lot of energy, and when diluted they soothe and envelop.",text2:"By the way! Black, white and gray are considered neutral colors and can be easily combined with everything else. The simplest combination is two opposing colors: red and green, yellow and purple, blue and orange. They are also called complementary or contrasting. Pure contrasting colors have great brightness and strong visual impact. To avoid getting tired of the interior, pay attention to their muted shades. For example, instead of bright green, use olive color in the interior. Black often serves as an accent color in living spaces, but gray serves as an excellent neutral base. Colorful spots will be the highlight of the gray monochrome. White walls are the ideal canvas for any design, from classic to high-tech. All combinations of bright and pastel colors play effectively against their background. Not only furniture, but also paintings make the center of the composition. Beige color in the interior is considered by some to be neutral, and it really goes with most colors. It is important to monitor the shade and choose the most successful tandems.",link:"https://dg-home.ru/blog/luchshie-sochetaniya-tsvetov-dlya-lyubogo-interera_b911659/",imgMain:na,img1:ca,img2:da,author:"Kateryna Asaturova"},{blogId:crypto.randomUUID(),date:"2023, January",title:"Kitchen decor: how to decorate the walls?",text1:"We come up with interesting options for wall decor for the kitchen.

We tell you how to decorate walls in the kitchen and share non-trivial design solutions. Choose a suitable location for your wall decor. In the kitchen these are areas above the table, cabinets, and sink. Free spaces between windows, niches, and the space above the door are also suitable. Make a composition in advance and try to arrange the elements on the floor. You can place the parts either symmetrically or chaotically.

Otherwise, stylistic dissonance will arise. Choose decor based on the interior style and color scheme. Objects can also be contrasting. However, make sure that they are in harmony with the surroundings. The decor of dark walls will be one thing, and the decor of light walls will be completely different. If the existing decor seems inexpressive, you can complement it with other decorations in a similar style. For example, place several more canvases next to the painting. The result is a mini-gallery that is sure to attract admiring glances. If you want to decorate your kitchen-dining room in an original way, create zoning using accessories.

For example, practical options made of thick fabrics or roller blinds are suitable for the kitchen. For the living room, elegant curtains or original light curtains. Choose your color scheme carefully. Focus on the primary colors in the setting. You can choose curtains of similar tones or play with contrast. Be careful with decor. Luxurious tiebacks and lambrequins are not always appropriate in the setting. Measure the width of the window opening. Heavy curtains will look awkward on narrow windows.

In this case, a wardrobe in the hallway is simply irreplaceable. Depending on the style of the interior of the house and the size of the room, it is possible to install a dressing room in the hallway, both with sliding doors and with hinged doors. Keep in mind that the compartment door is installed on guide rails that are attached to the floor and ceiling.
